# Today, I...

### April 24

* Created better error handling for Charcoal's LESS task. Since it's based off the same code that the grunt-contrib project's LESS task is, created a fork & pull request with the new code.
* Renamed Ember template tags in Charcoal. `emberTmpl` -> `ember_template` and `ember_named_template`.
* Renamed the `app/templates` folder in Ember Boilerplate to `app/pages`. Keeps it from being mixed up with `app/ember/templates` and is a more specific name for what it is.

### April 25

* Cleaned up the LESS code in Noted in preparation for adding a full-screening ability.
* Updated my ember-data fork with the newest version of the localStorage adapter from Noted, since several people asked about it in IRC.
* My [grunt-contrib pull request](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib/pull/2) got accepted & merged in
* Started to look into alternative templating systems for page templates in Ember-Boilerplate, because Handlebars on top of Handlebars doesn't exactly work. Too bad you can't set alternative open/closing tags in Handlebars.
