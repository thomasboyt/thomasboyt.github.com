# About me

I'm Thomas. I'm a 19-year old web developer and designer.

My most notable project so far is Chromapaper ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lpjpjcgbkjefppoahpegfajifjdmcblb) | [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Chromapaper)), an open source Google Chrome app that adds features to Instapaper. It has recieved coverage on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/#!5729430/instapaper-for-chrome-adds-offline-sync-to-your-long-articles) and [Download Squad](http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2011/01/10/chromapaper-unofficial-instapaper-app-for-google-chrome-allo/). While I no longer work on Chromapaper, the code is still available on my GitHub.

I've also done many small hobby projects, from video game server scripts to IRC bots to Twilio-powered SMS apps.
