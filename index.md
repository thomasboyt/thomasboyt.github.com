# About me

I'm Thomas. I'm a 17-year old developer, currently focusing on web applications.

My biggest released project so far is **Chromapaper** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lpjpjcgbkjefppoahpegfajifjdmcblb) | [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Chromapaper)), an open source Google Chrome app that adds features to Instapaper. It has recieved coverage on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/#!5729430/instapaper-for-chrome-adds-offline-sync-to-your-long-articles) (under a different, prior-to-notice-of-trademark-infringement name) and [Download Squad](http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2011/01/10/chromapaper-unofficial-instapaper-app-for-google-chrome-allo/). Currently, I'm working on other projects, though I do plan to continue Chromapaper development.
