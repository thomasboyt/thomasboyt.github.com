# About me

I'm a 19-year old front-end developer, currently attending [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com) in NYC. 

I like to build things. Recently, I've been building web applications with complicated front-ends and lightweight back-ends. 

I am also very bad at writing self-descriptions.

# Projects

*(everything below was done for fun and learning. If you'd like to give me money to build things for you, please [shoot me an email](mailto:me@thomasboyt.com).)*

## Web Apps

**Humbug Mobile** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/humbug-mobile)) - A mobile web application for [Humbug](https://humbughq.com). Made with Backbone, but kind of regretted not using Ember. Uses Python+Tornado on the backend, for easy asynchronous requests to Humbug's API and easy WebSockets on the client side.

**[Noted](http://noted.herokuapp.com)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Noted-App)) - A note-taking web application made for speed. Syncs with Dropbox, works entirely offline. Built on top of Rails, Ember.js, and a million other Gems and libraries listed on its [about page](http://noted.herokuapp.com/#about).

**Chromapaper** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lpjpjcgbkjefppoahpegfajifjdmcblb) | [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Chromapaper)) - A Chrome packaged app with over 5,000 users. Read Instapaper articles offline, in paginated view, and with position saving. Featured on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/#!5729430/instapaper-for-chrome-adds-offline-sync-to-your-long-articles) (under a different, prior-to-notice-of-trademark-infringement name). Was quite literally how I learned JavaScript, so... don't look at the code. For your own sake.

**[Timely Alarm Clock](http://timely-alarm.heroku.com)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Timely)) - A podcast alarm clock. Runs on Sinatra, HAML, SASS, and JavaScript, and a lot of jQuery plugins.

## Other Stuff I've Built

**Ember Firebase Adapter** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/ember-firebase-adapter)) - An adapter for integrating [Firebase](https://firebase.com) with [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data).

**humbot** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/humbot)) - A chat bot for [Humbug](https://humbughq.com).

**dom-binding.js** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/dom-binding)) - Tiny library for binding data to the DOM. Because sometimes you don't want the (relative) weight of a library like Knockout or Ember, but you also don't want to go around calling `$.html` everywhere. Tests written in QUnit.

**SMS Notification Bot** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/SMS-Notification-Bot)) - Sends you text messages if you get a notification (highlight) in IRC, and even lets you respond back. Runs on Skybot (bot) + Flask (server/Twilio endpoint) + Redis (message passing).

**Shootmania Server Script** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/shootmania-server-script)) - Fun project that interacted with Shootmania's XMLRPC API to be able to respond to commands given in the chat or events in the game. Wrote my own plugin architecture for it. Used to run on my Shootmania server, when I had one, as an alternative to the horrifying PHP+MySQL based official tools. Probably no longer works with the changes to the ManiaPlanet API, unfortunately.

*More projects in various stages of incompleteness can be found at [my GitHub page](http://github.com/thomasboyt).*
