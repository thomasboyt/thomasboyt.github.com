title: "Not Rewriting (or continuing the development of) Chromapaper"
---

This is a post I've been dreading to write, because I know how much some people are going to hate it, and possibly me, for it.

Three months ago, I said I'd rewrite Chromapaper. It was mired in awful design and code and overall yuckiness, and needed a rewrite so I could continue its development.

And for a while, I was working dilligently on the rewrite.  I never checked it into GitHub (I really need to set up automatic weekly remote pushes for projects where I'm the sole developer; some day I'm gonna have a hard drive failure and lose a couple weeks' worth of work), but trust me, work was done.

Problem is, I lost interest in Chromapaper development. Why?

* Rewriting projects is not fun! I spent a ton of time trying to wrangle code into a form I could deal with, but it was slow, extremely frustrating going. Every time I had my code rewritten how I thought I wanted it, a new bug would appear as a side effect of the new code. Besides that, there's also the total lack of enjoyment from rewriting code to do the same thing, as opposed to 
* School ended, and thus my need for Chromapaper. I was basically using it as a way to read articles during downtime at school, where there was no open wi-fi network available. 
* I stopped using Instapaper as much, and began making a conscious effort to read articles when they appeared in my RSS reader instead of saving them for later. For the really, really long articles, I got a Kindle.
* I wasn't satisfied with Chromapaper as a product, and didn't feel like with my current skillset, I could update it to be as much of a quality app as I wanted it to be.
* I was more interested in other projects than continuing to put my time into Chromapaper.

I'm sure many of those who used my application are wondering what to do now. There's several other Chrome apps and extensions that allow you to easily save pages for offline viewing. [Read Later Fast][read-later-fast] is the most popular and, in my opinion, highest-quality one. Sadly, this app doesn't offer Instapaper integration as of yet. If you'd like Instapaper to have built-in offline support someday, you may want to [email Marco Arment][marco-mail] asking for it (personally, I think it'd be a great feature to offer premium subscribers). Finally, Chromapaper is open source, so if you're technically minded you could always try to continue its development - be warned, though, that the code is pretty damn ugly.

 This is the first time I've ever had so many people use something I've created. It's also the first time I've ever had an application get media attention (thanks Lifehacker and others!). It's been a great experience for me, and something that's cemented my desire to eventually get real employment in web development. 

I want to thank everyone who emailed me suggestions, feedback, and words of encouragement; everyone who rated and reviewed the application on the Chrome Web Store; and, especially, everyone who donated. I'm sorry that I couldn't put in the effort the project that you guys deserved.
