# Replace your useless, high-volume RSS feeds with intelligent thoughts!

Look. You're probably not gonna believe me when I say this, but the blogs you read? They're killing you.

## The Why

Well, okay, not literally. Engadget's latest updates about another awful Chinese Android tablet are not directly giving you cancer. But the time you take reading - or, more likely, marking as read - these posts is taking away time from your day and distracting you.

I know what you're thinking: "that's the point! These sites give me something to check during the day when I'm bored, and they keep me informed!" The problem with that, though, is that, most of the time, they're really *not*.

See, the time you spend reading through the newest Joystiq headlines - "Activision Announces That There Will Someday Be Another Call of Duty Game!" - isn't time spent learning, it's time wasted. Anything important in gaming, you'll find out elsewhere, trust me. And really, do you *need* to read Techcrunch? Is it important for you to know about every round of VC funding a startup gets? Probably not.

Maybe you're not even really an RSS junkie. Maybe every link on the Hacker News frontpage right now is greyed out, or Reddit's frontpage is full of purple.

Whatever your ADD "news" vice is, I'm here to help.

It's time to take back your brain from the clutches of cat pictures and product announcements and replace it with *real content*.

It's time to start reading real articles again. And I'm gonna tell you how.

## The When

How often have you seen an article and thought, "eh, too long, I'll come back to it" and never did? Be honest. Maybe it languished, nested five folders deep in your bookmarks. Maybe you starred it in Google Reader, knowing full well that you haven't looked at your now-overflowing starred items list in weeks or months, and that you now have a backlog that'd take you as long to work through as it took to create.

The thing is, once you drop this information overload from your life, you're gonna have a *ton* of free time.

If you're going through your RSS feeds or checking up on Reddit or Hacker News, you're probably doing it to kill time. Are you going to those sites because you're taking a break from work? That's fine, sure. Just a couple minutes every hour never hurt anyone.

But are you doing it a *lot*? That's not so good. I'm not chiding you for shirking responsibilities - hell, I do that all the time. The thing is, though, if you're spending 15 minutes or longer reading web forums, social bookmarking sites, or RSS feeds, that's time you could be using a *lot* more effectively, even without doing "work". That's time you could be spending reading real articles, not xSlayerRocksx's opinions on Ron Paul's newest soundbite.

So when you find yourself spinning your wheels, **stop** and start doing something intellectually productive. Now, besides reading long-form articles, you could watch that TED Talk you've had bookmarked for a week, or check out some tutorials in a web framework you've been wanting to learn, or *anything* besides nothing. I do really think that reading is the most rewarding thing you can do during your "breaks", though.

## The How and Where

Long ago, these articles would have been found in newspapers or magazines. You'd get your newspaper and spend an hour in the morning and an hour after work reading through the pages, getting unbiased facts about everything that happened.  But nowadays, the average person could give a shit about the objective facts of a car bombing in the Middle East - there's nothing interesting there for them. 

At the same time, magazines, which once could be relied on for more insightful analysis and opinion in whatever specialization they had, have slowly been sapped of their content. Your average high schooler could write a longer essay than the usual front-page article of *Wired*, which now is pretty much just a home of neat but ultimately useless infographics. Even the magazines that have great content now upload most of it online, where it gets bookmarked and unread by you.
