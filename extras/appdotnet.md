App.net depresses the hell out of me. And not just because it has the most generic, meaningless name of all time (I mean, at least "imeem" had *character*).

First off, I won't deny that what Dalton is trying to with App.net is *noble.* In his [original proposal](http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal) (less than month ago!), he says that he expects people to "criticize me, my proposal, my past failures, my motivations."  But really, the issues with App.net have nothing to do with Dalton himself, or his motivation. He's motivated by a belief that web apps should not be held back because of advertising obligations. That, in itself, is incredibly respectable. 

And, if App.net had been *anything but* a social network, this post would not exist. There are many modern web and mobile apps that manage to do fine with minimal advertising based on subscription or single-payment models. Dalton mentions, in his original post about the failures of Twitter, that services like Dropbox had room for developer ecosystems to thrive (and thus, for users to thrive) because it wasn't held back by an advertising-based business model.

## The social network fallacy

Dalton's problem, though, is not understanding social networking is a massively different ballgame.

I think, if you want to see where things went awry, just look in that proposal blog post, down to where he quotes Paul Graham:

>Are 10,000 backers really a critical mass? I think so. Although Paul Graham is specifically describing a hypothetical new search engine rather than a new realtime feed service/API in [this inspiring blogpost](http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html), his assertions about the power of 10,000 committed users are highly relevant:

>>The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use. A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that size.

>>Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000 hackers, the route is straightforward: make the search engine you yourself want. Feel free to make it excessively hackerish. Anything that gets you those 10,000 users is ipso facto good.

Read over that, and tell me you can't *immediately see the fallacy.*

We like to pretend, sometimes, that hackers are the only thing that shape the web. Like some sort of weird "trickle-down word of mouth," where a new web app could spread from Hacker News down through Reddit and into our tweets and onto the iTunes App Store charts. And this is, of course, a major factor! The obvious example, of course, being Instagram.

But Instagram didn't become huge because of a Hacker News posting. It became huge because it solved a problem (sharing photos) with a fun twist (filters) and - so important, if we're going to be talking about social apps - *it had no critical mass needed to work.* Instagram could have stopped at ten thousand users instead of eighty million, and there would be zero loss in functionality.

On the other hand, something like App.net - *a social network onto itself* - could not succeed with ten thousand users. Not in the real world.

## Not the service we need, but the service we deserve

The second issue with Dalton's proposal is this idea that users are somehow *clamoring* for a new social network. Has this *ever* been the case?

Facebook didn't just succeed because everyone hated those MySpace themes with seizure-inducing animated GIFs and auto-playing music; it succeeded because it actually targeted a different segment of users in a different way. This is the issue that Diaspora ran into. These startups seem to believe that users are just waiting for the right service to jump ship to.

Look, I've watched as my friends complained about the New Timeline and made fun of the new Twitter ads and their ultra-artificial hashtags. No one loves Facebook or Twitter as software, honestly. But that's not what actually matters here. 

Going back to their pitch, App.net claims to want to make a service that "puts users first." Again, as I said, commendable. But what the fuck does that *mean* to the average user? Does it mean no ads in their feed? *My mom* has AdBlock that can handle those, and she still needs me to help her every time she accidentally closes her bookmarks toolbar. That's a solved problem for anyone who actually cares about it.

Of course, Dalton's point is not that banner ads are the ultimate evil, but that apps being constrained to their advertising obligations is. And for Twitter, that has meant API cut-offs and the slow tapering of outside access into Twitter, since I guess you can't trust developers to implement any ads you might serve them via JSON.

If you think that that *matters* to anyone outside of hackers and Twitter power users, you're out of your mind. I'll miss Tweetbot dearly, but shit, that won't somehow get me to jump ship to a new service where none of my friends are.

## Why are we pretending that this is a real venture and not a misguided fantasy?

I could go on, of course. Notice that I have not even *touched* on this being a paid application, at a hilariously steep cost of $50 a year. I have friends who won't try Tweetbot because they can't imagine spending $3 on Twitter, let alone a yearly subscription. I think if I told them "hey, you should get on App.net and follow me! It's only $50 a year!" they would actually punch me in the face.

Here's my ultimate point: **Twitter is a solved problem, and this will do absolutely nothing to disrupt it.** If you want to create yet another members-only club for Bay Area hackers like Quora, then sure, maybe this will actually work in that context. But if you think it will somehow revolutionize social networking, by showing that a handful of people will pay money for something, while *hundreds of millions* are fine with a free, ad-supported version, you're in for a rude awakening.

Just ask the Diaspora guys.
