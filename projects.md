# Projects

## Current

I'm currently working on learning more about various technologies before commiting to any more large-scale apps. Turns out that going into a project blind leads to bad practices and an unmaintainable codebase; who would have thought? ;)

## Past

**Chromapaper** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lpjpjcgbkjefppoahpegfajifjdmcblb) | [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Chromapaper)) - A Chrome packaged app with over 5,000 users. Read Instapaper articles offline, in paginated view, and with position saving. Featured on [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/#!5729430/instapaper-for-chrome-adds-offline-sync-to-your-long-articles) (under a different, prior-to-notice-of-trademark-infringement name).

**[Timely Alarm Clock](http://timely-alarm.heroku.com)** ([GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Timely)) - A podcast alarm clock. Runs on Sinatra, HAML, SASS, and JavaScript, and a lot of jQuery plugins.

**[Noted](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Noted)** - A note-taking web app inspired by VIM's modal editing. Built in Ember.js. Currently unreleased/in statis.

### Something Awful Forums extensions

**Fancy SA Forums** ([Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ohlohgldhcaajjhadleledokhlpgamjm) | [GitHub](https://github.com/thomasboyt/Fancy-SA-Forums)) - Restyling of the SA Forums, based on the current SA front page design. Also available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fancy-sa-forums/).
